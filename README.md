# **What's For Dinner?**

What's For Dinner is a feast of ideas for the uninspired, confused or otherwise indecisive home chef.

This project allows users to select what type of dish they need inspiration for and receive a suggestion at the click of a button. If they are so inspired that they think of their own addition, they can add a recipe that will be saved in the category notated or in a newly displayed "Other Dishes"
